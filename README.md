# furniture-dreams

This is a website I designed for my father's furniture business.
It's currently designed to be view-only, as in users can only view products 
available at his store and will not be able to actually purchase items due
to other situational constraints. 

Still to come: 
  - working contact submission form that would direct messages to our email
  - more detailed about me page
  - inspiration page to include other sources, perhaps Tumblr likes and Etsy favorites
  - contact us page have a call option that is available on Mac products with iOS 8+ 
    - not actually sure if that's possible, but that'd be cool
  - products for dining, living, and outdoor
  - "cart" - not actually a cart, but just so users can store products they're interested in
  and can reference later on, since purchasing isn't an option
